# HR-Analytics-Project

The management has contracted an HR analytics firm to understand what factors they should focus on, in order to curb attrition. In other words, they want to know what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay. Also, they want to know which of these variables is most important and needs to be addressed right away.

Model the probability of attrition using a logistic regression. The results thus obtained will be used by the management to understand what changes they should make to their workplace, in order to get most of their employees to stay.
